        <header>Introduction</header>
        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
        <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
        <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>

<!-- JAVASCRIPT AND JAVA SECTION -->
      <section id="javascript_and_java" class="main-section">
        <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
        <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others.
        The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
        JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason
        why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>

<!-- HELLO WORLD SECTION -->
      <section id="hello_world" class="main-section">
        <header>Hello world</header>
        <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
        <code>
          function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
          greetMe("World");
        </code>
      </section>

<!-- VARIABLES SECTION -->
      <section id="variables" class="main-section">
        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, 
            conform to certain rules.A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); 
            subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, 
            letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
            You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences 
            as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>

<!-- DECLARING VARIABLES SECTION -->
      <section id="declaring_variables" class="main-section">
        <header>Declaring Variables</header>
        <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:
            With the keyword var. For example,</p>
        <code>var x = 42</code>
        <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
        <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
        <code>
            x = 42
        </code>
        <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</p>
        <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
        <code>let y = 13</code>
      </section>

<!-- VARIABLE SCOPE SECTION -->
      <section id="variable_scope" class="main-section">
        <header>Variable Scope</header>
        <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable,
        because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, 
        it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
        <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
        <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
        <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
        <span>not defined</span></code>
      </section>

<!-- FUNCTION DECLARATIONS SECTION -->
      <section id="functions_declarations" class="main-section">
        <header>Functions Declarations</header>
        <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:</p>
        <li>The name of the function.</li>
        <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
        <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
        <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
        <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
        <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the 
        argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies
        the value returned by the function.</p>
        <code>return number * number;</code>
